# Neha Moopen-@nehamoopen 

Hello! I'm a Research Data Manager at Utrecht University Library :wave: <br/> 
I've a background in clinical psychology, and I've previously worked as a university teacher and junior researcher. 

I'm super enthusiastic about open science and open source projects + communities :rocket: <br/>
I've contributed to [Liberate Science](https://www.libscie.org/), [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome), and [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/). In 2020, I joined the second cohort of the [Open Life Science](https://openlifesci.org/) program.

When I'm not working, I'd love to be catching up on my non-fiction book collection - but I usually end up watching Netflix :smile: <br/>
On rare occassions, you might find me hanging out at the local bouldering gym :mountain:
