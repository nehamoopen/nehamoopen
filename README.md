# Neha Moopen-@nehamoopen 

Hello! I'm a [Research Data Manager](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management) at Utrecht University Library :wave: <br/> 
I've a background in clinical psychology, and I've previously worked as a university teacher and junior researcher. 

I'm quite enthusiastic about open science & open source projects + communities :rocket: <br/>
I've contributed to [Liberate Science](https://www.libscie.org/), [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome), and [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/). In 2020, I got to join the second cohort of the [Open Life Science](https://openlifesci.org/) program, which was developed through [Mozilla Open Leaders X (MOLx)](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/initiatives/mozilla-open-leaders/).

When I'm not working, I'd love to be catching up on my non-fiction book collection - but I usually end up watching Netflix.
On rare occassions, you might find me hanging out at the local bouldering gym :mountain:
